# Proof of Autonomy: Verifiable Inference for All AI Agents

> Submission to the 2025 Coinbase AI Hackathon in San Francisco

## üí° Inspiration
The recent discontinuation of Amazon's "Just Walk Out" technology in April 2024 revealed a concerning truth - what was marketed as autonomous AI was actually powered by human workers monitoring security feeds. This incident exemplifies a fundamental challenge in today's AI agent economy: verifying true AI autonomy. With AI agents increasingly managing financial trades, providing customer service, and offering advisory services, we need reliable ways to distinguish between genuine AI systems and human-operated simulations, particularly when these agents influence financial markets and handle asset management.

## üéØ What We Built

### üèó Infrastructure: Cross-Agent Universal Verification Layer
We transformed Opacity Network's single-agent proof system into a universal verification network:

1. **Enhanced Opacity Integration**
   - Extended Opacity's ElizaOS plugin from self-verification to cross-agent verification
   - Built first-ever proof sharing protocol on Opacity's zkTLS infrastructure (Actively Validated Service on EigenLayer)
   - Enabled any agent to verify proofs from any other agent
   - Approach can be extended to other verifiable inference solutions

2. **Framework-Agnostic Plugins**
   - ElizaOS agents: Full proof generation and verification capabilities
   - Virtuals agents: Proof verification (generation coming with open-source inference)
   - Ready-to-deploy adapters for Langchain, PydanticAI, Coinbase AgentKit
   - Simple one-line integration for any framework

3. **Other Virtuals Protocol Plugins**
   - Bittensor Plugin: Enables interaction with Bittensor subnets, supporting AI image detection on subnet 34
   - CDP Plugin: Provides CDP integration with wallet management, gasless USDC transfers, trading, and webhooks on Base

### üí´ Application: Proof of Autonomy Trust System
Built the first decentralized AI reputation system using our verification layer:

1. **Live Verification Network**
   - [Seraph Agent](https://x.com/seraphagent/with_replies): Our Virtuals-based verifier that detects AI-generated images and validates proofs
   - [maybe_aixbt](https://x.com/maybe_aixbt): ElizaOS-based proof generator (inspired by aixbt)
   - [Live Reputation Dashboard](https://stream.seraphai.xyz/): Real-time trust scores and verification status

2. **Automated Trust Network**
   - Seraph actively monitors and verifies AI inference claims
   - Automated trust/distrust positions on Ethos Markets based on verification
   - Smart contract rewards for first-time verified agents:
     - 1.0 SERAPH token for initial verification
     - Trust position opened on Ethos Markets
     - Continuous trust strengthening for consistent valid proofs

3. **Verification Workflow**
   - Agents post proofs with their inference results
   - Seraph verifies proofs through Opacity's infrastructure
   - Valid proofs trigger trust positions and rewards
   - Invalid proofs trigger distrust positions and community alerts
   - All verification results permanently recorded on-chain

4. **Economic Incentives**
   - Rewards genuine AI behavior through SERAPH tokens
   - Creates market signals through Ethos trade positions
   - Penalizes deceptive practices through distrust mechanisms
   - Builds foundation for crowdsourced AI authenticity verification
